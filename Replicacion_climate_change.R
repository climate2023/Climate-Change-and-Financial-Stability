## Lines 35-37: list of countries for which we wanted to replicate the paper
## Lines 41-55: loop that creates xts series for Price for each country
## Lines 58-61: large xts with several countries xts
## Line 63: duplicates the base just for comparative purposes
## Line 66 - 71: for loop that can be omitted, it is just an example showing which weekend days have na-values in all
## but one market, as we can see all of this days are 01st january.In India's stock markets, 01st january is not usually
## a holiday. Still, since it was only one country I removed the whole row, but I can interpolate the NA values if 
## necessary. The rest of the removed days are weekends.
## Line 72-77: creates a for loop that concatenate values where there are all but one or two NA's in the row to erase the 
## whole row. 
## Line 79: restricts the dates by erasing the dates obtained by for loop in line 124
## Line 82-84: interpolates the NA values for the base
## Line 86: restricts the dates so the resulting base has 0 NA's
## Line 88: creates the series of returns
